Covers design of digital systems. Includes Boolean algebra; combinational and sequential logic design; design and 
use of arithmetic logic units, carry-lookahead adders, multiplexors, decoders, comparators, multipliers, flip-flops, 
registers, and simple memories; state-machine design; and basic register-transfer level design. Uses hardware 
description languages, synthesis tools, programmable logic, and significant hardware prototyping.
